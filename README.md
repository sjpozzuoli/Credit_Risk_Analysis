# Credit Risk Analysis

### The purpose of this is to use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub and over and under-sample the data and use two machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk. Once that is completed, the performance of these models will be evaluated and a written recommendation will be made on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
